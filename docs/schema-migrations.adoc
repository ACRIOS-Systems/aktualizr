= How to add a schema migration

1. Copy schema.n.sql to schema.n+1.sql
2. Modify the schema as you see fit
3. Write a migrate.n+1.sql that will convert an existing data file in schema.n.sql format to one in schema.n+1.sql format. Note that old migrations must not be modified.
4. Update kSqlSchemaVersion in sqlstorage.h to n+1


Make sure that the migrate.n+1.sql file updates the 'version' table:

    DELETE FROM version;
    INSERT INTO version VALUES(...);
