= How to add a schema migration

1. Modify config/sql/schema.sql as you see fit
2. Write a config/sql/migration/migrate.n+1.sql that will convert an existing data to format in schema.sql. Note that old migrations must not be modified.

Make sure that the migrate.n+1.sql file updates the 'version' table:

    DELETE FROM version;
    INSERT INTO version VALUES(...);
