= cerdentials.zip file format

To authenticate on the ostree server, aktualizr uses cerdentials.zip archive.

The minimal requirement for this archive is including `treehub.json` file with
the following content:

```
{
  "ostree": {
    "server": "https://localhost:2443/api/v3"
  }
}
```

That minimal `treehub.json` listed above, is useful only for the servers without any authentication.
