# Hacky Implicit Provisioning version 2

This document describes a quick hack to test the implicit provisioning flow as it currently works in aktualizr before full support is available in meta-updater and on the server.

## Goals

* end-to-end installation of updates using OSTree

## Steps

1. Edit `recipes-sota/aktualizr/files/sota_autoprov.toml` in meta-updater:
* Remove the `provision_path` line.
* Add a line in the `[tls]` section with `server = "https://..."`. Use the URL from your account's credentials.zip file.
1. Edit `recipes-sota/aktualizr/aktualizr_git.bb` in meta-updater:
* Change `SRCREV` to `1c635c67d70cf38d2c841d449e750f08855e41a4`.
* Increment `PR`.
1. Build a standard image using bitbake. Make sure to set `SOTA_PACKED_CREDENTIALS` like normal.
1. Boot the image.
1. Optionally, verify that aktualizr is not provisioning. Make sure the device is not visible in the Garage.
1. Run `cert_provider` from the aktualizr repo: `cert_provider -c credentials.zip -t <device>`
1. Verify that aktualizr provisions correctly with the server using the device_id generated by `cert_provider`.

## Known Issues

At this time, although the device will be shown in the Garage, its installed package will not be.
